# Final Project for CSCE215

Justin Baum
21 November 2018

## Overview

This program will allow you to do a username based lookup of any user in CSCE215 for the Fall semester of 2018.

## Usage

Use the steps provided in the project specifications to run this.

```
$ tar xvf $USER.findname.tar
$ make
$ ./findName someuserid
```

## Notes

This program will only have 3 results. Either it finds a user, and outputs their full name. It does not find that user and displays an error message, or an illegal number of parameters are passed and an error message is generated.
